# *Kill-the-Virus*
Designed, fabricated and programmed (in assembly language), a game based on the Intel 8085 microprocessor. EAGLE was used for building the schematic and board layout of the PCB, which was later self-soldered at CEPD, NSIT. Link to the demonstration video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQp60EaMDg

## Project Overview
Kill-the-Virus is a lucid game-based project employing Intel 8085 microprocessor. It consists of a 6x6 LED matrix, with each lit-up LED approaching the player representing a 'virus' which is to be 'killed' by pressing the button corresponding to its column. There are two difficulty levels, which switch after a certain score is obtained. The number of kills make up the score, while missing even once causes the game to end. Points availed by the player will be displayed on a 16x2 LCD. IC 8255 will be used for input/output interfacing. The choice to make a game for the project was made so as to extensively study the architecture and learn how to program the microprocessor. This will enable understanding the 8085 microprocessor in an exciting way, though detailed.
