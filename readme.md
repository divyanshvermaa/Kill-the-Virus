# *Kill-the-Virus*
Designed, fabricated and programmed (in assembly) a game based on the Intel 8085 microprocessor. EAGLE was used for building the schematic and board layout of the PCB, self-soldered at CEPD, NSIT.

## *Project Overview*
Kill-the-Virus is a lucid game based project employing Intel 8085 microprocessor. It consists of a 6x6 LED matrix, with each lit-up LED approaching the player representing a 'virus' which is to be 'killed' by pressing the button corresponding to its column. There are two difficulty levels, which switch after a certain score is obtained. The number of kills make up the score, while missing even once causes the game to end. Points availed by the player will be displayed on a 16x2 LCD. IC 8255 will be used for input/output interfacing.
